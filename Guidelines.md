# Guidelines for contributing

1. Make sure you add the program in right directory. If adding new programs create a directory/sub-directory at appropriate place. 

2. Follow a consistent style, indentation and comment structure, use meaningful variable names and adopt other practices to write cean code, please refer to other programs for reference.

3. Do not add excessive comments. Instead add documentation for the program in a markdown file, place it in the same directory. If possible include time and space complexity analysis for the same. 

4. It should be ensured that the programs do not have any errors and run successfully across various compilers.
